## Introduction

The main objective of the `Template Management System` is to create template with Dynamic Data Placeholders and generate PDF Documents. This `TMS` system will save lots of time of industry and also man power.

User can create `Template` from `Default Template` or from `Scratch` of Template type and categories which is provided by their Admin or their own.

This system is best for industry, who have to create lots of document according to their need.
